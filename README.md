# Shared.js files Translator Tool

## Introduction

Every time we need to created resources for VueJS we used to create manually the resx, add the translation, replicate and translate for each language and finally sort it. With this tool we can automate the resx translations from one side.

This is a tool created by _Jota Pardo_.
